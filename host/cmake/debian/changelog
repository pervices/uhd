uhd (4.8.0.0-0ubuntu1) ubuntu_release; urgency=low

  * Highlights / Main Changes
    - Addition of rfnoc_modtool and further improvements to RFNoC Image Builder
      toolsets. This further improves the ability to design RFNoC blocks and
      create custom FPGA bitfiles.
    - Replaced RFNoC FFT block with a new version
    - Improved Windows installation capabilities including distribution
      of binary Python bindings for Windows though PyPI
  * New Features
    - Image Builder
      - Add GRC support. This allows designing RFNoC bitfiles from GNU Radio
        Companion (GRC).
      - Improve clock connection checks and checks for duplicate connections.
      - Improve IO port compat check (e.g., check if wire widths match).
      - Allow default clocks in domain checks.
      - Simplify image core YAMLs by better usage of RADIO_NIPC parameter.
      - Improve parameter resolution.
      - Improve error messages for missing YAML files.
      - Add --SYNTH and --CHECK options.
      - Add support for building an FPGA image using multiple parallel jobs and
        unique seeds with repeat_fpga_build.py and the --fpga-jobs option.
      - Add 'q' (or 'quote') filter to YAML files to allow quoting strings.
    - rfnoc-gain (OOT RFNoC example)
      - Overhaul directory structure, and rename to rfnoc-gain from
        rfnoc-example.
      - Simplify dynamic loading of OOT DLLs by using the new modules.d feature.
      - Add CE clock support to gain block. This enables the example on X4x0.
      - Add a GNU Radio subdirectory with examples of how to run the gain block
        in GNU Radio.
    - Add rfnoc_modtool. This is a command line utility to help design OOT RFNoC
      blocks and replaces the previously available blocktool.
    - RFNoC
      - Add tune requests. This allows tuning a complete graph as known from
        multi_usrp instead of single blocks individually.
      - Replace FFT block with a new version supporting larger FFT sizes and
        cyclic prefix insertion and removal.
    - multi_usrp
      - Add Python bindings for get_user_settings_iface()
    - General UHD
      - Add modules.d support
      - Add uhd::find_uhd_command() API call
      - Remove old-style Boost.Asio usage for compatibility with future versions
        of Boost.
    - Embedded Filesystem
      - Support for USB Audio devices on E31X, E320, N3XX and X4XX
    - Windows binary installer
      - Simplified the Windows installer experience by reducing the number of
        individual downloads from 4 (for USB devices) to 2, by including
        libusb.dll and USB driver installer files into NSIS-built installer
        binaries.
      - Add new cmake feature option called ENABLE_EXTEND_WIN_PACKAGING,
        which defaults to off. Enabling this feature will cause a number
        of convenience components to be included into the Windows deployment
        package (aka. installer).
        Enabling this feature has no effect on other platforms.
      - Added binary Python bindings for Windows installable through PyPI
        (pip install uhd)
    - Documentation
      - Add documentation about relationship of MTU, samples per packet and
        atomic item size
  * Dependencies changes
    - Increase minimum required versions
      - CMake to 3.12
      - Boost to 1.66
  * Bug Fixes
    - General UHD
      - Fix compatibility with DPDK >= 22.11
      - Fix compiler warnings for better compatibility with C++17 and 20.
      - Add logic for loading uhd.dll from the correct path for Windows with
        Python3.8+.
      - Add logic to warn about potential incompatibilities when importing
        Python bindings.
      - Remove duplicate results from find
      - Release GIL when calling find from Python which improves response time
        for large setups.
    - Python support
      - On Windows now also enable building python support if minimum supported
        python version is detected.
      - Changed version number format for build Windows binaries to common
        major.api.abi.patch format.
    - MPM
      - Allow images without RF frontend (will only be initialized if FPGA
        reports availability)
      - Fix usrp_update_fs to work for all embedded devices (and not just X4xx)
    - E320: Ensure consistent sequencing when powering on/off GPSDO
    - N310/N300: Fix LO query API for lowband LO
    - RFNoC
      - RFNoC DDC/DUC block (used in all Gen-3 USRPs and X410): Fix fractional
        frequency offset.
      - Fix AIS/spp calculation (e.g., for connecting FFT blocks).
      - Fix USE_IMPL rendering for the addsub block.
    - Image Builder
      - Fix colors
      - Fix error message for missing control SEP
      - Improve error reporting for invalid connections
      - Accept ~ and ~user on command line
      - Fix deprecated usage of yaml.load()
      - Ensure correct device tree files generation when choosing a custom build
        directory
    - rfnoc_modtool
      - Fix generation of noc_shells
